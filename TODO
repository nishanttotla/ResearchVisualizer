1. Tooltip for publication
2. Highlight arrows based on selected publication
3. Look up previous work
4. Use underscore.js to optimize older code
5. Memoize root computation
6. Simplify code structure in utils.js (needs thought)
7. Add more complex data for the graph
8. Path from one publication to another
9. The value of an edge should be defined by the degree of similarity in the two papers (by keywords, authors, etc.)
10. Allow tuning a graph by edge weight to reflect only stronger relationships
11. Characterize paths from source to target (by keyword etc.) to find which major ideas have flown along it
12. Are there intersting sub-structures in the graph (like number of paths from source to target mean something?)
13. Find influential nodes (given search keywords etc.)
14. Add separate function to initialize globals

LONG TERM:
1. How will the input data be constructed?
2. Efficiency concerns for large graphs?
