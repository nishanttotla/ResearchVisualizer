IMMEDIATE TASKS:
0. Check for duplicate links while adding links
1. Figure out a way to return multiple items to the browser
2. Experiment with straight arrows
3. Slide bar for filtering 'weak' links
4. Tooltip for publication
5. Make sure async database calls don't cause the visualization to crash (add checks before adding new nodes or links etc.)
6. Consider making a queue for user requests, just for safety and determinism
7. Add a minimum paper similarity value, like 0.1 or something
8. Add a list of authors/conferences/years seen so far, updated dynamically
9. Allow more controlled adding of citations (refine by conference etc)
10. Reconsider what size and color of the nodes mean
11. How to perform fuzzy queries on Mongo? (unnecessary for the initial version)

IMPROVEMENTS:
0. All variables and functions meant to be used globally must start with a capital letter
1. Use underscore.js to optimize older code
2. Memoize root computation
3. Simplify code structure in utils.js (needs thought)
4. Add separate function to initialize globals


IDEAS:
1. Highlight arrows based on selected publication
2. Path from one publication to another
3. The value of an edge should be defined by the degree of similarity in the two papers (by keywords, authors, etc.)
4. Allow tuning a graph by edge weight to reflect only stronger relationships
5. Characterize paths from source to target (by keyword etc.) to find which major ideas have flown along it
6. Are there intersting sub-structures in the graph (like number of paths from source to target mean something?)
7. Find influential nodes (given search keywords etc.)
8. Add a list of nodes that updates as more papers are added to the graph
9. Add a search box?

LONG TERM:
1. How will the input data be constructed?
2. Efficiency concerns for large graphs?
3. Look up related work
