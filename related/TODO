IMMEDIATE TASKS:
0. Check for duplicate links while adding links
1. Finalize a proper API for updating the graph
2. Find a way to retrieve abstracts/keywords
3. Node ids can't be 0-n anymore
4. Tooltip for publication
5. Make sure async database calls don't cause the visualization to crash (add checks before adding new nodes or links etc.)
6. Consider making a queue for user requests, just for safety and determinism
7. Debug syntax error

IMPROVEMENTS:
0. All variables and functions meant to be used globally must start with a capital letter
1. Use underscore.js to optimize older code
2. Memoize root computation
3. Simplify code structure in utils.js (needs thought)
4. Add separate function to initialize globals


IDEAS:
1. Highlight arrows based on selected publication
2. Path from one publication to another
3. The value of an edge should be defined by the degree of similarity in the two papers (by keywords, authors, etc.)
4. Allow tuning a graph by edge weight to reflect only stronger relationships
5. Characterize paths from source to target (by keyword etc.) to find which major ideas have flown along it
6. Are there intersting sub-structures in the graph (like number of paths from source to target mean something?)
7. Find influential nodes (given search keywords etc.)

LONG TERM:
1. How will the input data be constructed?
2. Efficiency concerns for large graphs?
3. Look up related work
