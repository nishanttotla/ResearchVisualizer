Questions:
1. What insight is the tool going after? How to evaluate whether the tool has improved user experience?
2. What are ways to reduce or prune the dataset? Is this necessary?
3. Datasets to look at : Zotero, Mendeley, DocEar, EndNote. Is this any better than scraping data from Google Scholar? Search for existing consumable data already available online.
4. Should the focus be a single/narrow area of research, or focus on interdisciplinary connections?
5. Sources for publications: http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/ERF/servlet/ERFmain?cmd=articles
6. More datasets: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/#citnets
7. Perhaps look at the Mendeley Chrome plugin that parses online metadata and puts it into the desktop app.
8. Many tools already make it easy to discover the popular publications. Can something be done to make the less famous radical ideas discoverable?
9. Creating exploration paths to help ease new researchers into particular domains.
