==================

A tool for visualizing and exploring research publications. Given the vast collection of research literature that exists and is being produced, searching for the right documents is a challenging problem. This is especially true for someone exploring a new area with little background. ResearchVisualizer aims to fix that by using visualization techniques to make the search process easy.
